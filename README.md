# Cube-Collector
My project for the Minigame Assignment in Game Design Workshop
Game Name: Cube Collector
Description: You are a sphere, collect the 7 cubes while avoiding the red bullets.
Controls: W/Up Arrow: Move Forwards; A/Left Arrow: Move Left; S/Down Arrow: Move Backwards; D/Right Arrow: Move Right
Dev Log: I made it so the player could move, I made the camera follow the player, I made bullets spawn and despawn when they reached a certain point on the map, I made bullets destroy the player, I made the player able to collect cubes, I made the cubes move, I made the turrets spawn bullets at random intervals
Assets: I used unity primitives to make this game.
